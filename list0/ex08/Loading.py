    Displays a progress bar in the terminal while iterating over a sequence.

    Acts as a generator that yields elements from the input sequence (`lst`)
    and updates a progress bar in the terminal.

    Args:
        lst (range): The sequence to iterate over.

    Yields:
        The next element in the sequence.

    Example:
        for elem in ft_tqdm(range(100)):
            # Perform some operation
            pass
